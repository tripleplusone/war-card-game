Hi there,

This is an implementation of the card game [War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)).  I've also included the results of 100,000 simulated games in case you don't want to run the code yourself.

Note: I coded two scenarios of what to do when you need reshuffle your deck: a random shuffle and keeping the cards in the same order. When I tried simulating games with the latter method, I ran into scenarios where games would run indefinitely.
